Hey Python lovers , you are on right place!
# Who am I ?
I am Mohit Kumar and I am a learner by doing just like you. I will be helping you all throughout your python Journey. If you only have seen python programming language then this place is for you. Here we do lot of stuff with python language. Just stay connected.
# Intro 
There are lot of things coming next , just stay connected but only if you have chose python language for commiting your time for next 2-3 months for becoming a intermediate level programmer form beginner and then to an advance level programmer.
Here you will learn python by `project based learning` not ordinary codes.
# Why you should do project based learning
