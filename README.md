# Email-valid-or-not
*Hello to everyone is reading this!
Today I created a small project of checking whether or not your email is valid universally :) 
# Checking whether the least character of the email are availbale or not I mean the least characters are 6 , How a@g.in(a stands for first character which should be in small case and there should be a @ present not more than 1 time)
# Some more things I have commented out in my code.
Created this as a beginner and improving more.
Believes in project based learning.
This is just an example of my project journey and will posting some more
